## Current live registered job

D4M8Q2VN completed DiffusionGemma inference on all 7,709 frozen RRT notes with zero failures and zero label access. F7K3Q9MV is now running the registered RRT evaluation at project commit 097bf046a1c7eceb50d71d75e82e79f3993acb00.

The currently running job is not changed by documentation-only commits.

## Interpretation rule

Use canonical RunRelay aggregate artifacts and exact provenance for every numerical update. Do not populate a pending result from job progress, logs, or expectations.

H6 alternative instruments are sensitivities. Do not use point-estimate differences to select a preferred instrument post hoc.

The authoritative registered forward sequence is docs/10_POSTREGISTRATION_EXECUTION_AND_EXTENSION_PLAN_2026-09-30.md. The separate post-registration exploratory decision-model plan is docs/11_POSTREGISTRATION_DECISION_MODEL_EXTENSION_PLAN_2026-10-01.md.
