## Current live registered job

The registered DiffusionGemma arm is complete for all three outcomes: ventilation delta AUROC -0.00811 (95% interval -0.02030 to +0.01445), RRT -0.00083 (-0.00283 to +0.00244), and MetaVision ICU death +0.00499 (-0.00654 to +0.00652).

The broad respiratory-support endpoint arm is complete. W4Y8P6N2 reported comparator AUROC 0.70385, augmented AUROC 0.69741, delta AUROC -0.00643, and 95% refit-bootstrap interval -0.01879 to +0.01046, with 500/500 valid bootstrap replicates and zero replacements. Artifact SHA-256: 824114f7217a3a5af6806ce6b4e413e4ec070edd865f21ee2bb60e68c3c2ea80.

Y6Z3R8M4 is now preparing the registered CHARTEVENTS storetime sensitivity at validated project commit 27a061c25d88e56a155c93c83514a7a63b6cb298; this preparation reports aggregate availability loss and opens no predictive performance.

The currently running job is not changed by documentation-only commits.

## Interpretation rule

Use canonical RunRelay aggregate artifacts and exact provenance for every numerical update. Do not populate a pending result from job progress, logs, or expectations.

H6 alternative instruments are sensitivities. Do not use point-estimate differences to select a preferred instrument post hoc.

The authoritative registered forward sequence is docs/10_POSTREGISTRATION_EXECUTION_AND_EXTENSION_PLAN_2026-09-30.md. The separate post-registration exploratory decision-model plan is docs/11_POSTREGISTRATION_DECISION_MODEL_EXTENSION_PLAN_2026-10-01.md.
